# Python Project Template for beginners

## Introduction

This is an easy to use, no fuss template, to assist ProQuickly clients (and
anyone else who needs this) to get started with python.

Note at this time, this document and approach assumes a basic proficiency with
using a computer for software development. A video guide for this will be
coming soon to help complete beginners.

### Creating this takes time...
I'd appreciate it if you'd

Thanks!

## Prerequisites
1. A computer! (this should work on Mac and Linux, as well as Windows,
including wsl - a much better choice than plain windows).
1. Install git. Be sure to set the environment variables for user and password.
1. If you want to use an online git service you will need to signup online,
create an ssh key locally and then add  it to the online service. I use
and recommend gitab.com. I am a M$-free zone.
1. Install docker.
1. Download pycharm from jetbrains.com (this setup is only tested on pycharm).
1. Note that if you have a .edu email address jetbrains will give you a free
license to all their commercial products, renewable annually. If no edu, then
download the community version. It's still really great.
1. Install pycharm.

That's it. Nothing else needed, not even python (because everything not
mentioned above will run in a container).


## Getting started
1. copy the ssh url of this repo.
1. Open up pycharm.
1. In the new project screen enter the repo url.
